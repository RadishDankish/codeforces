check range of numbers stored in ARRAY as they can be very big.
to check if power of two (x&(x-1))==false then power of two;
to get last digit -> n%10
AM>=GM
sum of two sides of triangle > third side

To find prime we can find them in pairs and one of number is below sqrt(n)
----> other above so check only till sqrt(n)

sieve of erastothenes-> go to multiples of prime and mark them as non
prime, starting point is square of that number ex- for 7 start from 49
(initialize an array of n size and initially mark everything as 
prime and then start crossing out)
